## Installation

### Method 1: Claude.ai Project Knowledge

1. Go to your Claude Project
2. Navigate to **Project Knowledge** section
3. Click **Add Content** > **Upload Files**
4. Upload each skill `.md` file from this folder
5. Skills will automatically trigger based on keywords

### Method 2: Claude Code (Local Skills)

1. Copy skill files to your Claude Code knowledge directory:
```bash
cp BD-Automation-Engine/docs/Claude\ Skills/*.md ~/.claude/skills/
```

2. Skills will be automatically discovered on next Claude Code session

### Method 3: Individual Skill Upload

For specific skills only:
1. Open the skill's `.md` file
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into Claude Project Knowledge as a new file
4. Name the file with the skill name (e.g., `job-standardization.md`)

## Integration with BD Engine

### n8n Workflows
Skills designed to integrate with:
- Apify Job Import Workflow
- Enrichment Processor Workflow
- Priority Alert Notification Workflow

### Python Scripts
Corresponding scripts in `BD-Automation-Engine/Engine*/scripts/`:
- `job_standardizer.py` (Engine2)
- `program_mapper.py` (Engine2)
- `contact_classifier.py` (Engine3)
- `bd_scoring.py` (Engine5)

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Read relevant skill before starting task
- Combine multiple skills for complex workflows
- Update skills when processes change
- Use exact schema values from skills
- Validate pain points with multiple sources

### DON'T:
- Ignore skill guidance for "faster" approach
- Use generic templates when skills provide specific ones
- Skip classification steps
- Approach executives before HUMINT gathering
- Use unvalidated intel in outreach

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Triggering
- Check keyword match in query
- Verify skill uploaded to Project Knowledge
- Use explicit reference: "Using the bd-call-sheet skill..."

### Outdated Information
- Update pain points and contacts as new HUMINT gathered
- Refresh Notion Collection IDs if databases recreated
- Review and update program details quarterly

### Schema Mismatches
- Verify Notion property names match exactly
- Check select field values include emoji prefix
- Confirm multi-select fields use array format
